Hi, i'm Ambra, 19 years old from Italy. I'm interested in radio electronics, low level programming, OS development, frontend and backend development, reverse engineering and PCB design.  
Unrelated hobbies include [photography](https://www.flickr.com/people/190109522@N05), and at least attempting to draw and make music.
